These are my recommended must-have applications that you should try to use (at least)

<!--truncate-->

## Linux
1. WPS Office - a versatile alternative to Microsoft Office, including word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, PDF conversion, and more.
2. Telegram - a freeware, cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging, video calling, and VoIP service.
3. Sublime Text - a shareware cross-platform source code editor. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages. Users can expand its functionality with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.
